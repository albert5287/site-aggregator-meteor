# site-aggregator-meteor

The purpose of the application is to allow users to share, discuss and rate pages they find on the internet. The app also needs to have the following features:


Use Bootstrap

Users can register and login

Users can post new websites if they are logged in. Websites posted by users should have a URL and a description

Users can up and down vote webpages by clicking a plus or a minus button.

Websites should be listed with the most up voted site first

The listing page shows when the website was added and how many up and down votes it has

Users can move to a detail page for a website (using routing)

On the detail page, users can post comments about a webpage, and they are displayed below the description of the webpage

Use the HTTP package for Meteor to pull in information about the posted web links automatically, so the user does not need to enter anything other than the URL

Implement a search function that allows the user to search within the listed sites for keywords

Recommend websites to users based on things they have up voted and commented on. E.g. if I up vote a site entitled ‘Tofu recipes’, it would recommend other sites with ‘tofu’ and ‘recipe’ in their titles or descriptions

Deploy the application using the Meteor deploy command
